This program is designed to allow a user to quickly calculate and sonify different types of scales. 

The left column will always calculate a 12 Tone Equal Temperment (12TET) scale. The cents calculation on the far
left will always be comparing the novel scale to that of a 12TET scale. The center column is where the novel 
scale will be displayed.

"TET" - Choosing "TET" will calculate a new scale in the same way that a 12TET scale 
is created. The difference is that it allows the user to input any number of octave subdivision that they would like.
The program will compare the newly created TET scale with that of a 12TET scale and will pull out 8 tones that
best fit that of a 12TET. This is why regardless of how many subdivision are chosen, the program will only 
display 8 tones. Note: Choosing an octave divider that is a whole number multiple of 12 will yield a standard
12TET scale. 

"Just" - The "Just" scale (Sometimes referred to as the Pure Tone Scale) is a scale that is based off of the 
small whole number ratios of the harmonic series. Those ratios are [1, (9/8), (5/4), (4/3), (3/2), (5/3), (15/8), 2].

"Pythagorean" - The "Pythagorean" scale is created with the idea of using the most harmonious interval 3/2 (second 
most harmonious, the first being the octave) to generate a scale. The eight tones are realized by starting at a 
pitch and going up a fifth(3/2) or doing down a fourth (4/3). Using the fourth doesn't break the rules of only using
3/2 because a fourth is simply an inverted fifth. 

"Ratio" - The "Ratio" option is less musical and more proof of concept. Just like how the Pythagorean scale is
created from a generator interval of 3/2. The ratio option allows you to compose a scale that is generated from 
other small whole number ratios of the harmonic series.
